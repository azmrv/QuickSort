//! Application facade implementation combining all use cases.
//!
//! # Design Decision
//! The `ApplicationFacadeImpl` is a **single class** that implements all
//! inbound ports (`ExecuteOperation`, `UndoOperation`, `GetFolders`,
//! `ManageFolders`). This is intentional:
//! - Adapters (Tauri commands, IPC handlers) need only a single reference to
//!   the facade, not to individual use cases.
//! - It simplifies dependency injection and lifetime management.
//! - The facade itself contains **no business logic** — it merely delegates
//!   to the appropriate use case. This keeps the facade thin and testable.
//!
//! # Alternatives Considered
//! - **Separate classes per port**: Would require adapters to hold multiple
//!   references and duplicate wiring. Chosen approach reduces boilerplate.
//! - **Dynamic dispatch (trait objects)**: The facade could implement the
//!   ports as trait objects. However, using concrete types allows the
//!   compiler to inline calls, improving performance.
